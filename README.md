# Google Foobar

In case you don't know what Google Foobar is, it's a [very cool] hidden challenge by Google, which invites you to participate directly from the search page. It has 5 levels, with increasing difficulty and a very generous time limit for each problem. 

I'm uploading my code for educational purpose *only*, for interested programmers to see what kind of problems they might face. The codes will be uploaded periodically so not to upset folks at Google!

Level 1
* Solar Doomsday

Level 2
* Elevator Maintanance
* Ion Flux Relabeling

Level 3
* Fuel Injection Perfection
* The Grandest Staircase Of Them All
* Prepare The Bunnies

Level 4
* Bringing A Gun To A Guard Fight
* Running With Bunnies

Level 5
* Disorderly Escape


I'll also post explanations on my blog so stay tuned.
